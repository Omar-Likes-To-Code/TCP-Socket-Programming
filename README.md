# TCP-Socket-Programming
Here we create a socket programming interface that provides the routines required for interprocess communication between a Host and a Client using Java.  A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
